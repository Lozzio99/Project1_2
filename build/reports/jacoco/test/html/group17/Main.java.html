     * on possible cached values.
     * Improves accessibility from external threads and allows direct
     * reading-writing actions from external monitors without compromising
     * the threading flow.
     * In order to do this, it is necessary to write on the instance whenever
     * there's need to flush updated information and instruction on the main
     * heap, and this will be automatically done from any thread it is
     * writing on the simulation instance.
     * To avoid bad ordering of the passed instructions,it is therefore necessary
     * to contains logical blocks within the instructions updating
     * on the simulation cached instance.
     * A good advantage of this is the happens-before condition which is
     * implicit in the volatile keyword: meaning all instruction
     * written before of the actual writing on this instance will be
     * kept in the same ordering as they are passed, due to the uniqueness
     * of the information pool, leading to stability when forking tasks
     * and then applying them in order.
